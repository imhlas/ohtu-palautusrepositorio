In the Start, Stop, Continue, and More of, Less of Wheel technique, eam members evaluate actions in five categories: what to start, stop, continue, do more of, and do less of. This quick meta-process discussion lasts 10-25 minutes, varying with group size.
Participation involves drawing a circle divided into sections for each category. Team members suggest actions for each category, which are then discussed and specific follow-up actions are decided upon.

In the Glad, Sad, Mad technique, the participants list observations from a sprint, categorizing them as Glad (positive notes), Sad (negative notes), or Mad (broader gripes, often external).
These are then voted on for discussion priority. 
Participants write brief notes about the sprint on cards, then describe and categorize them on the whiteboard under Glad, Sad, or Mad. Issues are grouped, voted on, and discussed in descending order of votes, focusing on actionable steps for the next sprint. The session concludes after an hour or once all issues are addressed.
